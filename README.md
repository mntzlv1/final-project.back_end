# My Node.js Project

This project is a full-stack web application that integrates multiple functionalities, making it a useful and interactive platform. Throughout the development process, I focused on implementing user authentication, QR code generation, BMI calculation, email sending, weather information retrieval, and a simple blog system. The goal was to learn and apply real-world web development concepts using Node.js and Express.

## 📌 What I Learned

Working on this project helped me:
- Understand **user authentication** with MongoDB and Express.js.
- Work with APIs for **weather data retrieval** and **email sending**.
- Implement **QR code generation** dynamically in a Node.js app.
- Store and retrieve **blog posts** with CRUD operations.
- Improve my JavaScript, Node.js, and database management skills.

## 📂 Features Implemented

✅ **User Authentication** – Register, Login, and Secure Access.  
✅ **QR Code Generator** – Generates a QR code for user-provided input.  
✅ **BMI Calculator** – Calculates BMI based on height and weight.  
✅ **Email Sending** – Allows users to send emails using a configured SMTP service.  
✅ **Weather Info** – Fetches real-time weather data based on user input.  
✅ **Blog System** – Users can create, edit, and delete blog posts.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Node.js** & **Express.js** – Backend development
- **MongoDB** & **Mongoose** – Database management
- **EJS** – Template engine for rendering views
- **Axios & OpenWeather API** – Fetching weather data
- **Nodemailer** – Sending emails
- **QR Code Package** – Generating QR codes
- **Bootstrap & CSS** – Styling the frontend

## 🔧 How to Run the Project

1. Install this folder and open on your vs code
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**  
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your MongoDB connection string, API keys, and email credentials.

5. **Run the project:**  
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## 🔥 Challenges Faced

🚧 **Authentication Issues** – Setting up authentication and handling JWT tokens properly took some effort, but I learned how to securely store and verify user sessions.  
🚧 **API Integration** – Working with external APIs like OpenWeather and Nodemailer required debugging to ensure proper data retrieval and email functionality.  
🚧 **Database Handling** – Structuring the database correctly for storing user info and blog posts was challenging but rewarding.  

## 🚀 Future Improvements

🔹 Enhance the UI for a better user experience.  
🔹 Add password reset functionality.  
🔹 Implement user roles (admin vs regular users).  
🔹 Optimize API calls to reduce load times.

## 🤝 Contributions

This project was a solo effort, but I welcome feedback! If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to reach out or fork the repository.
